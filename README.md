# Chrome-Extension-for-Phishing-URL-Detection
Due to rapid growth of internet cyber attacks also increasing. One of them is phishing. Phishing is a Technique in which attackers steal sensitive or confidential information such as usernames, passwords,credit card details, personal identification numbers (PIN) etc.... from internet users. The traditional approach to detect phishing attacks is a centralized blacklist approach and heuristics but they usually fail to detect zero-day attacks. The goal of our project is to implement a Phishing detection using machine learning model which classifies whether a given URL is legitimate or a phishing URL by using chrome extension


further implementations of this project is,Visual similarity can be handled by NLP. and can Increase speed and accuracy by deep learning techniques .
